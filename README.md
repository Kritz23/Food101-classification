The project includes training, validation, and testing phases, ensuring robust evaluation of model performance. 
The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient food image classifier leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and pretrained models.
In this project, we performed transfer learning using three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: GoogLeNet, MobileNet V3, and NASNet Large.
